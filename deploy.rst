How to Deploy a Solution
==========================


To gain access to a live sandboxed environment please contact your F5 Account Team.

To access your dedicated lab environment, you will require a web browser
and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) client software. The web browser will be used to
access the Lab Environement. The RDP client will be used to connect to the Jump
Host, where you will be able to access the BIG-IP management interfaces (HTTPS, SSH).

| 1. Establish a RDP connection to **jumphost.f5lab.local**  with the following credentials:    |                           
|                                                                                               |
|    - **UserID: f5lab\\user1** / **Password: user1**                                           |
|                                                                                               |

| 3. Type **cd c:\\solutions\\[solution #]\\postman**                                           |
|                                                                                               |
| 4. Type **Newman run [name of postman collection] -e [name of environment variables] -k**     |

| ..note::  Reference each Solution Guide's Postman Collection section to deploy to determine   |   
|           the appropriate Postman Collection to run                                           |
|                                                                                               |
| 5. Access the appropriate BIG-IP using the credentials below                                  |
|                                                                                               |
